This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the ConcurrentModificationException and its solution. The ConcurrentModificationException is a common error that occurs when a collection is modified while it is being iterated over using an iterator that does not support concurrent modification. This example showcases how the exception occurs and how it can be avoided using an iterator that supports concurrent modification, or by iterating over a copy of the list.
